# Week 5 Day 2 Assignment: Custom React Native Components and Styling

Welcome back to I400/590! Today, we'll convert the JavaScript functions you used to create `View` elements into proper React Native components. We're also going to touch on how to apply styles to these custom components. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

- Completed Week 5 Day 1 Assignment or equivalent.
- A working React Native development environment.

## Concepts Covered

- Custom React Native components
- Styling React Native components

---

## Assignment Instructions

### Part 1: Create Custom `Student` Component

#### Task

1. **Open Previous Assignment**
   - Open your project from the W5A1 assignment.

2. **Create Custom Component**
   - Create a new React Native component called `Student`.
   - This component should mimic the functionality of your previous `View` components that displayed student data, however the data (name and grade) should be passed in through the component tag in JSX.

#### Evaluation Criteria for Part 1

- **Component Creation**: Successful creation of a custom `Student` component.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be well-organized and adhere to best practices.

### Part 2: Style Your `Student` Component

#### Task

1. **Add Styling**
   - Implement styling to your `Student` component. This can be as simple as changing text colors or as complex as adding borders and shadows.

#### Evaluation Criteria for Part 2

- **Styling**: Effective application of styles to the `Student` component, making it visually distinct.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be clean and well-organized.
