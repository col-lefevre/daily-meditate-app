## Overview

This is a simple, low-fidelity Meditation App which I created as an Informatics Undergradate student at Indiana University, specifically for INFO-I 400/590 Cross-Platform Mobile Programming. My main objective was technically challenging myself to create a fully functional mobile application from the ground up. The app is therefore not based on any particular meditation strategies, and is not positioned as a solution / product.

## Features

The app is built using React Native, and is specifically designed for Android--I could push to iOS, but don't have an iOS device to test the application. Users of the app go through a linear meditation process in which they:

-   Select a prompt and timer
-   Meditate on that prompt (with background music) for the duration they selected
-   Leave notes on their experience
-   (Optional) Review their past notes on meditation experiences
