# Week 6 Day 2 Assignment: Enhancing Gradebook with Destructuring, ScrollView, and FlatList

Welcome back to INFO-I400/590! Today, we're diving deeper into more advanced React Native topics. We'll learn about best practices, such as how to write comments in JSX and the benefits of destructuring props directly in the component definition. Moreover, we'll understand how to efficiently render lists of components using ScrollView and FlatList. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

- Completed Week 5 and Week 6 Day 1 assignments or equivalent.
- A functional React Native development environment.

## Concepts Covered

- Explaining JSX via VoiceThread
- Destructuring props in the component definition function parameters
- Rendering lists of components using ScrollView and FlatList
- The distinction between when to use ScrollView and FlatList

## Assignment Instructions

### Part 1: Destructuring and Explaining JSX

#### Task

1. **Destructure Props**
   - Open your assignment from Tuesday.
   - In the custom component definitions, destructure the props directly in the function parameters.
2. **Explain JSX over VoiceThread**
   - Record a VoiceThread session where you explain component hierarchies or any logic you've added in your JSX.

#### Evaluation Criteria for Part 1

- **Destructuring**: Props should be correctly destructured in the component definitions.
- **VoiceThread Explanation**: Your explanations on VoiceThread should be clear, concise, and provide meaningful context.

### Part 2: Implementing ScrollView and FlatList

#### Task

1. **ScrollView for Gradebook Entries**
   - Convert your list of gradebook entries to be rendered within a `ScrollView` component.
2. **Switching to FlatList**
   - Comment out the ScrollView.
   - Implement a `FlatList` that renders your list of gradebook entries.
   - Ensure that each gradebook entry in your FlatList has a unique key. (Hint: Consider using the student name or a unique ID as the key)

#### Evaluation Criteria for Part 2

- **ScrollView Implementation**: Gradebook entries should be scrollable using the ScrollView component.
- **FlatList Implementation**: Gradebook entries should be efficiently rendered and scrollable using the FlatList component.
- **Uniqueness**: Each gradebook entry in the FlatList should have a unique key.
